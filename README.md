Bite's Mission is to help feed people in need while also stopping excess food waste.

Bite is an idea conceived by its founder, [Christian Hurtado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianhurtadonyc/). Christian saw the amount of food waste and the amount of hungry people in New York City and he thought one problem could be used to solve the other. Growing up, Christian‚Äôs mother was one of seven siblings in a low-income family and sometimes they would go to sleep hungry. Whenever she recalls those times, her eyes begin to tear up and in addition to the sadness and frustration her parents must have felt, she remembers the pain and hurt of what it is like to go to sleep hungry. This story not only taught Christian the value of a meal, but instilled him with a mission.

The Bite Team is confronting food insecurity in their community head on. Every Sunday at noon the team cook and serve food to people in Brooklyn and Queens. Christian and crew are now serving more than 80 meals every Sunday (and 1,400 YTD!). Want to learn more about how you can help Bite?
